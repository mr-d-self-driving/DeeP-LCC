# Python Implementation of Code
Here, there are some implementations in Python for the Matlab code in the repository.

In order to run this code, you will need both the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/), [CVXOPT](https://cvxopt.org/) and [SCIPY](https://scipy.org/install/) libraries installed (Recommended using pip to install both).

It is recommended to run 'pip install --upgrade pip' in order to update pip to the latest release before installing. 

## Installing NumPy
  1. Ensure that Python is installed, and that pip is updated. 
  2. Run 'pip install numpy' in a terminal window.

## Installing CVXOPT
  1. Ensure that Python is installed, and that pip is updated. 
  3. Run 'pip install cvxopt' in a terminal window.

## Installing SciPy
  1. Ensure that Python is installed, and that pip is updated. 
  3. Run 'pip install scipy' in a terminal window.
